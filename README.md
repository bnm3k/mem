## Introduction

Matrix multiplication is a classic example for demonstrating how memory access
patterns significantly impact an algorithm's runtime. The `O(N^3)` algorithm
remains unchanged but by optimizing the way memory accessed, we can improve the
runtime by as much as 40x.

## Straightforward algorithm

We'll be focusing on NxN (square) matrices where N is assumed to be very large.

Matrix multiplication involves taking two matrices A and B and combining them
into a new matrix C.

For each element in C, we take the dot product of the associated row in A with
the associated column in B. The mathematical definition from wikipedia is
definitely clearer and more precise:

This definition also lends itself to the following straightforward algorithm
[1]:

```C
#define N 2
typedef double matrix[N][N];

void multiply(matrix A, matrix B, matrix C, int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            double res = 0.0;
            for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
                res += A[i][k] * B[k][j];
            }
            C[i][j] = res;
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    matrix A = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}};
    matrix B = {{5, 6}, {7, 8}};
    matrix C = {0};
    multiply(A, B, C, N);
    // C: [ 19.0  22.0
    //      43.0  50.0 ]
    return 0;
}
```

A couple of points worth pointing out from the above code snippet:

- Its complexity is `O(N^3)` where N is the length/width of the matrix. For each
  entry in C, we do N amount of work, there are N^2 entries, thus N^3.
- Every entry per source element (A & B) is read N times

The goal of this post is to detail how the straightforward approach can be
optimized with regards to memory accesses. Before going any further, we'll need
to introduce caching in computer systems, plus some key terms and definitions:

## Caches & Locality

A basic computer system consists of the CPU and a memory system for data
storage. Transferring data back and forth from memory is quite slow from the
CPU's perspective. Therefore, in practice, a cache is added in between the CPU
and memory to speed up access and bridge the processor-memory gap.

Note, in this discussion, I'll treat the cache as a unified component but if you
dig further in [1], the cache is in fact composed of multiple caches (L1, L2,
L3) each organized hierarchically with the higher caches (the ones closer to the
CPU) holding a smaller subset of the data compared to the lower ones.

The cache's function is twofold: keep frequently accessed data close to the CPU
and keep neighbouring data close by. This strategy leverages the concept of
**locality**.

Programs usually exhibit two kinds of locality that contribute to the
effectiveness of caching:

- **temporal locality**: once a program references a memory location, it's
  likely to reference it again multiple times in the near future [1].
- **spatial locality**: once a program references references a memory location,
  it's likekly to reference nearby locations in the near future [1].

Thus, caching the contents of a memory address plus the adjacent data into a
singular block that's stored in a cache line advances both temporal and spatial
locality.

## Caches, Reads and Writes

With caches in the picture, reads and writes carried out by the CPU become a bit
more complicated.

When the CPU performs a read for a word (the data unit referenced by an
address), the word's associated block is first checked in the the cache. If the
block is present, we get a **cache hit**. However, if absent, we get a **cache
miss**: its block has to be fetched from memory, then the address's contents
loaded into a register in the CPU.

As detailed in [1], writes are a bit more complex. There are two cases:

- **write hit**: the address being written to is already in the cache as a
  block. When writing to it, there are two approaches:
  - **write-through**: upon writing to the cached block, also update its
    underlying block in the memory. Advantages: You can evict a cache line
    without having to write it to memory. Also, in a multi-core setup, it
    guarantess consistency trivially. Disadvantage: every write results in a
    block transfer back to memory; this increases traffic/decreases relative
    performance.
  - **write-back**: defer updating the underlying block in memory until
    necessary (such as when evicting the block from the cache). Meanwhile, the
    block in memory remains stale. Advantage: decreases traffic by exploiting
    locality (we might write to the same location soon or to nearby locations).
    Disadvantage: Implementation is more complex - in a multi-core setup, we now
    require a cache coherency protocol to maintain consistency [3].
    Additionally, some evictions will result in writes to memory [3].
- **write miss**: the address being written to isn't cached. We have two
  options:
  - **write allocate**: Also called fetch-on-write, and as its alternate name
    suggests, it involves fetching the associated block from memory into cache,
    then treating it as a write hit (use either write-through or write-back
    approaches). Advantages: exploits locality especially if paired with the
    write-back approach. Disadvantage: every write-miss results in a block
    transfer into the cache.
  - **no write allocate**: on a write-miss, bypass the cache and write the data
    unit directly to memory. The cached block has to be invalidated such that if
    read soon after the write, it will result in a cache miss. There are
    situations where no-write allocate is more advantageous, for example (TODO
    memset, i-cache?)

Since write-back and write-allocate complement each other well with regards to
locality, they are often paired.

## Exploiting locality

Given that caches leverage locality, for optimal performance, we need to exploit
both temporal & spatial locality when writing our programs. Let's start with a
simple example, summing up all the values in a two dimensional array:

```C
int get_sum(int a[M][N]){
  int res = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < M; i++){
      for (int j = 0; j < N; j++){
          res += a[i][j];
        }
    }
  return res; 
}
```

This seemingly simple snippet takes advantage of both temporal and spatial
locality. The 2-D array consists of `M` rows each containing `N` columns (i.e. N
ints). In C, such arrays are laid out in memory in a
[row-major order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row-_and_column-major_order).
Therefore, when summing up the elements in the above snippet, the inner-loop
iterates through the first row, then the second row and so forth [1]. The local
variable `res` should be cached in the CPU register by the compiler therefore
making iterative writes to it fast (temporal locality). Upon a cache miss,
chunks of the array are loaded into memory block by block. Thus, the next read
is a cache hit enabling the program to take advantage of spatial locality.

Now, suppose we interchange the i and j loops as follows:

```C
int get_sum(int a[M][N]){
  int res = 0;
  for (int j = 0; j < N; j++){
    for (int i = 0; i < M; i++){
          res += a[i][j];
        }
    }
  return res; 
}
```

The program traverses the 2-D array by going down the first column, then the
second and so on.

![row-major traversal vs column-major traversal](assets/mm/traversals.svg)

It is still the same from a correctness perspective (addition of ints is
commutative) and it still does the same amount of work from a
theoretic/complexity perspective (`O(MN)`). However, its "actual" performance is
quite poor compared to the prior row-by-row version. Given how 2-D arrays are
laid out, it fails to take advantage of spatial locality. In fact, if `N` is set
to the size of the cache, each inner-loop addition requires a fetch from a lower
level and might even evict previous rows that we'll need to access again when
summing up the next column. All these make the performance gap quite evident.

TODO: carry out an actual benchmark

In both cases, we see what's referred to as a **stride pattern**. The row-by-row
version exhibits a _stride-1_ pattern - the best-case for spatial locality. The
column-by-column version exhibits a _stride-N_ pattern, the larger N is the more
spatial locality decreases.

## Key Takeaways so Far

Let's pause a bit and take stock of the 'best practices' highlighted so far (all
these are referenced from [1]):

- when iterating, take into account the stride and try to reduce it as much as
  possible so as to exploit spatial locality. Stride-1/sequential access is
  optimal given that contiguous data in memory is cached in blocks.
- use/re-use a data-object as much as possible to maximize temporal locality
- when optimizing for writes, for simplicity's sake, assume the caches are
  write-back write-allocate. These already tends to be the case in modern
  computer systems. For example in my laptop (purchased in 2020), the L1
  d-cache,L2 and L3 caches are write-back and presumably write-allocate. In
  linux, you can use the [dmidecode](https://linux.die.net/man/8/dmidecode) tool
  to check your cache info(`dmidecode -t cache`)
- for nested loops, pay attention to the innermost loop since it's where the
  bulk of the work is done.

Now, back to matrix multiplication:

## AB Routines for Matrix Multiplication

Recall we started with the following straightforward matrix multiplication
routine:

```C
int i, j, k;
for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    for (j = 0; j < N; j++) {
        double r = 0.0;
        for (k = 0; k < N; k++) {
            r += A[i][k] * B[k][j];
        }
        C[i][j] = r;
    }
}
```

The outermost loop increments i, then the middle loop increments j, then the
innermost loop increments k. We shall refer to this as the `ijk` version. Let's
focus on the work being done in the innermost-loop:

```
r += A[i][k] * B[k][j];
```

Given that k is incrementing in the innermost loop while i and j remain
constant, the traversal of A is row-wise with a stride of 1 while the traversal
of B is column-wise with a stride of n (n is assumed to be very large thus
negating any instance of spatial locality).

![AB traversals](assets/mm/AB.svg)

Additionally, each iteration involves 2 loads (reads from A and B), and zero
stores. Suppose a cache line holds 64 bytes and a double is 8 bytes. With the
row-wise traversal of A, we'll get a cache miss when loading the 0th value in a
block and cache hits on the next 7 values. Therefore each iteration will involve
0.125 misses when referencing A. With the column-wise traversal of B, each
reference per iteration will result in a cache miss. We ignore the store
involving C since it's done outside and majority of the work/time spent will be
inside the loop. In total, there will be 1.125 misses per iteration.

Now that we have a bit of experience interchanging for-loops, we could switch
i-j to j-i as follows. This will be the `jik` version:

```C
int i, j, k;
for (j = 0; j < N; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        double r = 0.0;
        for (k = 0; k < N; k++) {
            r += A[i][k] * B[k][j];
        }
        C[i][j] = r;
    }
}
```

As we'll see in the benchmark results section, `ijk` and `jik` have essentially
the same performance due to having the same memory access pattern (1.125 misses
per innermost iteration) in the innermost for-loop. Thus, they both fall under
the same equivalence class of AB.

Can we do better? Yes, definitely:

## BC Routines for Matrix Multiplication

Let's start with the following diagram:

![Loop directions for i,j,k](assets/mm/loop_directions.svg)

Observe that if we make the for-loop for j the innermost one, we'll get a
row-wise traversal of matrix B and C which will be of stride-1, thus maximizing
spatial locality.

Translating this into code, we get:

```C
int i, j, k;
for (k = 0; k < N; k++) {
    for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        for (j = 0; j < N; j++) {
          C[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j];
        }
    }
}
```

`A[i][k]` remains constant in the innermost loop therefore we can place it in a
temporary variable and the compiler will cache it in one of the CPU registers:

```C
// kij
int i, j, k;
for (k = 0; k < N; k++) {
    for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        double r = A[i][k];
        for (j = 0; j < N; j++) {
          C[i][j] += r * B[k][j];
        }
    }
}
```

As is the case for the AB class, we can permute the k and i for-loops to get
`kij` and `ikj` versions:

```C
// ikj
int i, j, k;
for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    for (k = 0; k < N; k++) {
        double r = A[i][k];
        for (j = 0; j < N; j++) {
            C[i][j] += r * B[k][j];
        }
    }
}
```

Both versions should have the same performance since they entail the same memory
access patterns:

![BC traversals](assets/mm/BC.svg)

Let's analyze the work getting done per each iteration (of the innermost
for-loop):

```C
C[i][j] += r * B[k][j];
```

Suppose the cache is write-back, write-allocate and a cache line holds 64 bytes.
Both B and C are being traversed row-wise with a stride of 1. We've got two
loads: one for `B[k][j]`, and one for `C[i][j]`, which has to be loaded before
getting updated. This update does involve a subsequent store operation. The
store operation will not result in a write miss due to the preceding load. The
load involving A is ignored since it's carried out outside the loop. There will
be a cache miss every 0th load and the next 7 values will be straight cache
hits. Therefore there will be 0.25 (0.125 + 0.125) misses per iteration vs the
1.125 for AB routines.

Despite BC routines carrying out more memory accesses per iteration compared to
AB routines (2 loads and 1 store vs 2 loads only), they perform better courtesy
of less cache misses per iteration. The store doesn't end up hurting performance
as much since under a write-back system, the writes can go directly to the cache
and only during eviction does the memory get updated [4].

While we've seen how we can get better performance, it's worth also seeing how
we can get way worse performance.

## AC Routines for Matrix Multiplication

By making the innermost for-loop be the one that increments `i`, we get the AC
routines: `jki` and `kji`. These traverse A and C column by column:

![AC traversals](assets/mm/AC.svg)

Applying the same kind of analysis as for AB and BC routines, there will be 2
loads and a store per iteration and 2 cache misses per iteration due to the
stride of n.

For the sake of completion, here's the code sample for `jki` and `kji`

```C
// jki
int i, j, k;
for (j = 0; j < N; j++) {
    for (k = 0; k < N; k++) {
        double r = B[k][j];
        for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            C[i][j] += A[i][k] * r;
        }
    }
}

// kji
int i, j, k;
for (k = 0; k < N; k++) {
    for (j = 0; j < N; j++) {
        double r = B[k][j];
        for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            C[i][j] += A[i][k] * r;
        }
    }
}
```
