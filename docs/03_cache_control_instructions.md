# x86 Cache Control Instructions

Traditionally, the L1, L2 and L3 SRAM caches are meant to be managed solely by
the CPU. After all, from the perspective of the user's program, the abstraction
available for non-persistent data is that of memory; caches are there purely for
performance. They could be managed by the user or even the OS, but from
['What Every Programmer Should Know About Memory'](https://akkadia.org/drepper/cpumemory.pdf)
by Ulrich Drepper:

> ... the gains of having fast memory would be eaten up completely by the
> overhead of administering the resources. So, instead of putting the SRAM under
> the control of the OS or user, it becomes a resource which is transparently
> used and administered by the processors.

Recently, I used the [cpuid](http://www.etallen.com/cpuid.html) command to
retrieve detailed cache and memory details for my system. Contrary to the above
description, I did come across what seemed to be support for OS and user level
cache control instructions (some present, most meant for future systems and one
that's already been deprecated). Here was the cpuid output (slightly formatted,
non-relevant lines have been filtered out):

```
---------------------------------------------------------
CLFLUSH line size                               = 0x8 (8)
CLFLUSH instruction                             = true
---------------------------------------------------------
CLFLUSHOPT instruction                          = true
---------------------------------------------------------
CLDEMOTE supports cache line demote             = false
---------------------------------------------------------
CLWB instruction                                = false
PCOMMIT instruction                             = false
---------------------------------------------------------
CLZERO instruction                              = false
---------------------------------------------------------
WBNOINVD instruction                            = false

WBINVD/INVD acts on lower caches (L1d cache)    = false
WBINVD/INVD acts on lower caches (L1i cache)    = false
WBINVD/INVD acts on lower caches (L2 cache)     = false
WBINVD/INVD acts on lower caches (L3)           = false
---------------------------------------------------------
PREFETCHWT1                                     = false
---------------------------------------------------------
L1D_FLUSH: IA32_FLUSH_CMD MSR                   = true
---------------------------------------------------------
```

Before going further, let's define a linear address since this term will come up
when describing some of these commands. A **linear address** is the virtual
address generated by a program at a given instance that's then segmented by CPU
right before it's translated into the physical address. Without getting into too
much technical minutiae, a program that's loaded consists of the code segment,
data segment, the stack region plus more - segmentation therefore entails
figuring out which segment an address points to. For more details, check the
[wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_memory_segmentation), on x86
memory segmentation.

Back to the output above: Most of the the description's are sourced from
[Felix Cloutier's x86 reference](https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/) which in
turn is based on Intel's x86 reference:

- `clflush <address>`: Flushes a cache line: "Invalidates from every level of
  the cache hierarchy in the cache coherence domain the cache line that contains
  the linear address specified with the memory operand. If that cache line
  contains modified data at any level of the cache hierarchy, that data is
  written back to memory" [1].
- `cflushopt <address>`: similar to clflush but is more optimized, or rather
  cflushopt has less overhead than clflush by providing less guarantees.
- `cldemote <address>`: A performance hint that demotes a cache line from the
  level closest to a CPU core to the next lowest one. On usage, it "may
  accelerate subsequent accesses to the line by other cores in the same
  coherence domain, especially if the line was written by the core that demotes
  the line" [1]. Furthermore "Unlike CLFLUSH, CLFLUSHOPT, and CLWB instructions,
  CLDEMOTE is not guaranteed to write back modified data to memory" [1].
- `clwb <address>`: Similar to clflush but upon writing back a modified cache
  line to memory, it does not flush it away from any/all of the cache levels -
  so as to speed up any subsequent reads. Upon getting written, the line's state
  is changed to 'non-modified' as per the cache coherency protocol.
- `clzero`: AMD specific instruction that clears out the cache line by setting
  every byte to zero (as per this
  [wikichip](https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/x86/clzero)) entry. It's meant for
  handling certain memory errors.
- `invd`: priviliged instruction that "Invalidates (flushes) the processor’s
  internal caches and issues a special-function bus cycle that directs external
  caches to also flush themselves. Data held in internal caches is not written
  back to main memory". [1]. Unlike most previous commmands listed, this one's
  probably not meant for improving peformance.
- `wbinvd` & `wbnoinvd`: both are priviliged instructions that write back _all_
  modified cache lines to memory. wbinvd invalidates the cache lines meaning
  future reads/writes will have to retrieve the value from main memory. wbnoinvd
  does not invalidate the cache line.
- `prefetchw <address>` & `prefetchh <address>`: a performance hint for
  prefetching a cache line from main memory.
- `pcommit`: For ensuring writes to persistent memory have been committed. It's
  been deprecated though. For more details, check out this
  [stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/41878148) and this
  [Dan Luu post](https://danluu.com/clwb-pcommit/) where he discusses both clwb
  and pcommit instructions.
- L1D flushing (via writing to the `IA32_FLUSH_CMD` msr: this feature seems to
  be meant for security mitigation (see this
  [discussion](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Paranoid-L1d-Flush-x86-CPU-5.15)).

As you can see from my cpuid output, most of these cache control instructions
and features are not universally supported yet (at least on consumer-grade
systems). Their presence though shows that there's a need to give the OS and
user more control over L1, L2, L3 caching, be it for performance or for security
reasons. It remains to be seen how commonplace they become. For the time being,
I'll end with this excerpt from John McCalpin's post titled:
["Intel’s future “CLDEMOTE” instruction"](https://sites.utexas.edu/jdm4372/2019/02/18/intels-future-cldemote-instruction/):

> Cache hints are only weakly effective at improving performance, but contribute
> to the increasing costs of design, validation, and power. More of the same is
> not an answer — new thinking is required...
>
> Continuing to apply “band-aids” to the transparent caching architecture of the
> 1980’s will not help move the industry toward the next disruptive innovation.
